                <p class="other-Text" id="bio">I am an electrical engineering graduate from the University of Texas at Austin. I currently work along side a construction team in order to develop code compliant, cost 
                    efficient electrical system installation designs for Walker Engineering. After two years in the trade, I have come to realize how dependent we are on web based appilactions
                    in our day to day to activites. Interaction with these applications, along with the lucrative opportunities in today's market, has sparked my interests in the tech industry.
                    That sparked interest has led me to this course and needless to say, I am excited to begin my journey into learning the in's and out's of full stack developing. </p>
